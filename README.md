# dog-breed-classifier
This repository contains code related to a CNN that can classify various dog breeds from an image. I created this as a part of the capstone project for Udacity Datascience Nanodegree. I had a lot of fun implementing this project. I created a detailed report here : https://premys.medium.com/building-a-dog-breed-classifier-using-a-cnn-1599ac0ece29 

# Installation
The code contained in this repository was written in Python and largely used the OpenCV and Keras libraries. Specifically the following Python packages were used: sklearn, keras, numpy, glob, random, cv2, matplotlib, tqdm, PIL and IPython.
